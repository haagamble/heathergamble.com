Today we moved to Athens. After nearly thirty years living in Central Asia, this feels like the beginning of something entirely new.  <!-- excerpt -->During those years I learned Tajik, and I picked up some Russian along the way. Language learning has been part of my daily life for a long time — not just as a learner, but as a coach walking alongside others.

Now I’m starting again, this time with Greek.

I’ve decided to keep a language-learning diary to track what I’m actually doing: what I try, what works, what doesn’t, and what I notice along the way. I’ve been coaching language learners for about twenty-eight years, and I’ve learned a lot about how languages are acquired in real life, not just in theory. Greek gives me a chance to step fully into the learner’s seat again and apply those insights from the beginning.

My goal is to post at least once a week, sometimes more. Along the way, I’ll also share language-learning ideas and practices that have shaped my own journey — things that might be helpful to others who are learning, restarting, or simply curious about the process.

This is very much a work in progress — and that’s the point.

About a year ago I had the opportunity to spend a week in Greece. In preparation for my trip I downloaded Duolingo and worked through some of the lessons and learned the alphabet. But I didn't use the app much after that, and when I opened it today I didn't recognize any of the Greek words. So ...

Day 1 - I erased my Greek progress in Duolingo and started over. It is my first day in Greece, and I did Duolingo lessons for about an hour. I'm excited about learning a new language. This was a good start for day 1.
