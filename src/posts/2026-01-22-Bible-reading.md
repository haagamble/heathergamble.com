I think starting to read early is an important and helpful strategy. By reading, I don’t mean simplified texts written for learners, but native texts — materials that native speakers themselves read. Even when comprehension is minimal, early exposure to authentic language helps learners become familiar with patterns, structure, and the written form of the language.

For Greek, I decided to begin reading the Bible. It works particularly well because it can be read alongside an English translation. I use the YouVersion app, which allows two versions to be displayed side by side. I chose a widely used Greek version paired with an English translation and decided to start with the Gospel of Matthew.

I began this on my fourth day of learning Greek, which meant I understood almost nothing. That was expected. Matthew chapter 1 is a genealogy with a highly repetitive sentence structure—X the father of Y, and Y the father of Z. My goal on that first day was not comprehension, but practicing reading Greek letters and establishing the habit of reading early. I copied one verse into ChatGPT and asked it to explain the words, making sure to say that I was a complete beginner. The explanations that the AI chatbot gave me were simple, and very helpful. I read through the entire first chapter that day.

A helpful feature of the Greek Bible in the app is the built-in audio. I listened to a verse while reading along, then paused the audio and read it myself. This combination of seeing, hearing, and speaking was especially helpful.

On the second day, I read chapter 2 of Matthew. After reading and listening, I selected four verses and asked ChatGPT—one verse at a time—to explain key words and some basic grammar. I did not try to understand everything in the chapter. I can't - I am still a beginner. My focus was on reading the Greek letters and noticing repeated words.

On the third day, I decided to slow down rather than reading an entire chapter. I wanted to spend more time understanding what I was reading. Since then, my routine has settled into reading about fifteen to twenty verses a day and choosing four or five to explore more carefully.

After a week of this, I am already beginning to recognize a growing number of words. Some come from repetition within the biblical text itself — words like heaven, when, say, and with. Others overlap with what I am encountering in Duolingo, such as brother, water, he, and and. This overlap is one of the strengths of eclectic language learning: when multiple resources are used together, they reinforce one another naturally.

I encourage language learners to start reading early, even if the material feels challenging. It is okay not to understand much at first. Read a little at a time — even one or two verses is enough. The goal is not immediate comprehension, but familiarity, exposure, and growing confidence in reading. Over time, understanding increases naturally, and reading becomes smoother and more fluent.
