  <h1>Learning, building, and sharing—one project at a time.</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a language-learning coach and longtime learner (Tajik, Russian), now starting again with Greek.
    I also build practical resources—websites, tools, and projects that help people learn.
    This site is my hub for what I’m working on and what I’m discovering along the way.

  <p><strong>If you’re new here:</strong> the diary is the most “real-time” part of the site. The articles are the evergreen resources.</p>
